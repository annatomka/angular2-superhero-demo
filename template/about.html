                <p>This is a simple site that makes it possible to vote for an important question: Who is better: Batman or Superman?
                    You can fill out the form on the homepage and watch whom others vote for in real time on statistics page. You can only vote once, so think about your choice wisely :)
                    <p>
                    By the way this site was built for the event Google IO Extended 2015 for demonstration purposes, but I thought people would be interested in it so I made it public. I hope you like it!</p>
