     *##What is an application?
     *
     * Each Angular application has its own zone, change detection, compiler,
     * renderer, and other framework components. An application hosts one or more
     * root components, which can be initialized via `ApplicationRef.bootstrap()`.
     *
     *##Application Providers
     *
     * Angular applications require numerous providers to be properly instantiated.
     * When using `application()` to create a new app on the page, these providers
     * must be provided. Fortunately, there are helper functions to configure
     * typical providers, as shown in the example below.
     *
     * ### Example
     * ```
     * var myAppProviders = [MyAppService];
     *
     * platform()
     *   .application([applicationCommonProviders(), applicationDomProviders(), myAppProviders])
     *   .bootstrap(MyTopLevelComponent);
     * ```
     *##See Also
     *
     * See the {@link bootstrap} documentation for more details.

     *##Usage
     *
     * `bindingFn` is a function that will be called in the new application's zone.
     * It should return a `Promise` to a list of providers to be used for the
     * new application. Once this promise resolves, the application will be
     * constructed in the same manner as a normal `application()`.

     *

     * specified application component onto DOM elements identified by the [componentType]'s
     * selector and kicks off automatic change detection to finish initializing the component.
     *
     *##Optional Providers
     *
     * Providers for the given component can optionally be overridden via the `providers`
     * parameter. These providers will only apply for the root component being added and any
     * child components under it.
     *
     * ### Example
     * ```
     * var app = platform.application([applicationCommonProviders(), applicationDomProviders()];
     * app.bootstrap(FirstRootComponent);
     * app.bootstrap(SecondRootComponent, [provide(OverrideBinding, {useClass: OverriddenBinding})]);
